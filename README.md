# A Robust Estimator of the Efficient Frontier

The repository contains a replication of the code from the article, as well as
a module, named `robustcov` for simulating portfolio weights using the MCO
method, as well as convex optimization on a denoised covariance matrix.

In the folder `notebooks` you can find application of NCO algorithm on the numeric
example from article (`notebooks/block_simulated_optimization.ipynb`) and
real-world application on provided data as well as application for 5 years
investments and some analysis
(`notebooks/portfolio_analysis.ipynb`)

1. In folder `notebooks` you can find application of module on real-world
   and synthetic data.
2. In folder `reference` you can find some theoretical stuff i used to
   maintain this project (kernel estimations, some formalism)
3. In `replication` folder you will find code, provided by the authors of the
   [article](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3469961),
   that i refactored.
4. In the folder `robustcov` you can find scripts from `replication`,
   united in module that are used in `notebooks` folder.
5. I wanted to cover module with tests, so the `tests` folder was created,
   but i didnt have anough time for this

### ðŸ›  Installation and Dependencies

`git clone` and `cd` to the folder with project and then use the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt;
pip install -e .
```

### ðŸ’¹ Usage

Basic usage is shown in the `notebooks` folder. The most straightforward is
block simulated optimization, described in the article:

```python
def numeric_example():
    np.random.seed(0)

    blocks_num, blocks_size, blocks_corr = 10, 5, 0.5

    # generate synthetic data
    mu, cov = init_mu_cov(
        blocks_num=blocks_num,
        blocks_size=blocks_size,
        blocks_corr=blocks_corr,
    )

    # choose NCO and convex optimizers on denoised data
    optimizers = [
        ConvexOptimizer(),
        NCOOptimizer()
    ]

    # init estimator
    estimator = PortfolioCreater(optimizers=optimizers, print_every=10)

    # obtain matrix of weights, where rows - trials and columns -
    # simulated weights for corresponding assets
    return estimator.estimate(mu, cov)



results = numeric_example()

```
